# ✈️ SKY- ANALYTICS: Analyzing Indian Flight Prices and Patterns

Unlocking the dynamics of Indian flight pricing through data, visuals, and storytelling!

---

## 📊 Project Overview
Flight fares in India fluctuate based on myriad factors—airline, route, timing, booking lead time, and more. This repository aims to uncover patterns and insights from Indian airfare data using a blend of **Python**, **SQL**, **visualization**, and **statistical analysis**.
